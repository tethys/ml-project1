%% 1)found and remove outlier by plotting histogram of y
%% 2) center the input data, except the categorical variables, plot their histograms
%% 
%% 3)seem there is correlation between input-output (except categorical values)
%%  find if there is correlation between input/outupt
%%  plot also histogram of every x feature wrt y

%% is one feature is not correleated with output, should not remove it, keep it
%% maybe it is important in relation with others
%% 
%% 4) Initial model trial:
%% for b0 only test loss(yTr, mean(yTr)), loss(yTe,mean(yTr)), NOT yTr!!!
%% Linear least squares in not going to work perfectly, look at size and rank of XTraining, 
%% should be 8 here but it is 6, some feature correlation
%%
%% However there is an improvement in rmee from mean-b0 to linear model with rank deficient least squares
%%

%% Use dummy variables!!!
%% show image

%% First feature with respect to the other features!! Print that
%% Ridge regression will deal with deal with that by shrinking the weights
%% If a variable is not correlated with an output and with any other feature, it might be ok to remove it

%% Repeat the steps with another train/validation set, before doing cross validation.
%% The data seems to be iid

%% plot various lambda, then again in a smaller another interval for ridge regression
%% Improved a bit, but not super much

%% add another term, a squared term, 3rd squred term did not work. Sqrt of the data helped
